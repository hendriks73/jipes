Jipes is a Java open source library that allows you to efficiently compute audio features. Possible uses for these
features are general music information retrieval ([MIR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval))
applications or more specifically personal music software like [beaTunes](http://www.beatunes.com).
